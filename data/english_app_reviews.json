Despite the period of time since first using Uber I only recently decided to use the UberOne memebership. What a mistake! I have been charged two monthly fees within two weeks and the refusal to deal with the matter or even have the facility in-app to adequately manage the query is just dismal and appalling.

After some time when I reached my destination ( by some other way) the ride got booked. And the driver asked to cancel the ride when I told about the issue. Then Uber is charging me compensation charges for such rides. What are these traps, I am going to fade off of so, I am writing this reviewüò°.",

Both my Personal and Work profiles share the same payment methods which is absolutely stupid. To delete a payment method from one is to delete from both. Also the Change Payment Method workflow is arcane. It needs to he done through the receipt, where the apps of competing services allow a payment change in the Active Order. Bruh.",

If it was the driver who dropped me off a few days ago, I didn't tip him for the mere fact that he stopped abruptly and removed himself from the driver's seat to confront a pedestrian and almost hit a woman and her family. Lyft needs phone numbers so we as riders can dispute bad rider ratings.",

I got a driver to me faster by canceling the standard ride and selecting the wait and save option... what is the extra cost for..? Double charges, prices being quoted significantly lower than what you end up paying, quite a few reckless drivers. The app set up is good, it's easy enough to navigate, but that's completely been overshadowed by all of these issues lately.",

In my case, the driver hadn't moved for 10 minutes, which is abnormal for the traffic conditions of the area so imagine my shock when I go to contact them to ask if everything is alright, the app says he's waiting at the pickup spot. Basic garbage bugs like that should not be making it into production.",

    "Review": "This company is extremely deceptive and won't hesitate to steal your money. Don't trust the charge amount listed when you book a ride. They will sneak in hidden fees. I just booked a trip for $9 and got charged an extra $15 for a service added on that I didn't ask for. That was the money I needed to get to work. Now I have to explain to my employer why I can't show up because I have no transportation money. These people are thieves and con artists. Avoid this app!!",

When we got in contact with them they did nothing to help. Said that the drivers behaviour are not their responsibility. And they didn't want to give out his contact information. I contacted the airport and the police who also did nothing. Partner missed flight. Got bag back after 18 h. Missing Chromecast and snus. Don't use Bolt.",

However, they are not but are waiting for the timer to run down and then claim the fare as a no-show. This has happened to me on nearly every booking I have made. Never put your credit card details in this app! Even when paying cash, drivers try to make out the fare is calculated wrong and try to charge more. Complete scam app now. AVOID.
